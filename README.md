## Introduction

Nowadays, there are many online English learning platforms available that can help anyone who wants to learn English. These platforms provide excellent reading and writing methods of learning. However, on the speaking side, these platforms often only set a good example for pronunciation and let the learners try to copy the audio recordings without any feedback on the learner’s performance.

This can result in some learners not pronouncing the words correctly and repeating the same mistakes without knowing their pronunciation is actually incorrect.

## Motivation

The question that arises from our research, and which we hope to tackle, is:

**“How can we increase the effectiveness of learning how to speak in English?”**

We hope our research can provide a positive outcome and bring good motivation that can help learners speak English with confidence. Therefore, we aim to build a platform named **Speaktoo** that can give proper feedback on the learner’s pronunciation and help improve their pronunciation to build up confidence in speaking English.

## Goals

- Provide real-time feedback on pronunciation to help learners improve.
- Enhance the effectiveness of English speaking practice.
- Build learners' confidence in speaking English.

## Features

- **Pronunciation Feedback**: Real-time analysis and feedback on pronunciation.
- **Practice Mode**: Interactive practice sessions with immediate feedback.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor and track learning progress over time.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for all age groups.
